# my-journey-of-reactjs
This repository is for tracking my reactjs learning. I will share my journey on daily basis and update this readme.

## Day 01: Sep 06, 2025 (06/09/2025)
I started learning react js from Jonas Schmedtmann. Topics I have covered: Why FE frameworks exists, React vs Vanilla Javascript, Pure React, Setting up dev environment, & New way of creating react app using vite. I completed first 3 sections of the course and the 4th one is js refreshing so I didn't watch it. Created my first react app using npm install -g yarn + yarn create react-app my-app, this npx create-react-app not worked for me.

## Day 02: Sep 07, 2025 (07/09/2025)
Topics I have covered: working with components, props, and JSX. I learned rendering root component & strict mode, JSX, JS logic in components, separation of concerns, styling react apps, passing and receiving props and props immutibility, one way data flow, rendering conditionally with && and ternary operator.

## Day 03: Sep 08, 2025 (08/09/2025)
Topics I have covered: solved a coding challenge using react. Setting classes conditionally, Build a simple component, Handling events in react way & React State. Revised topics using notes.


## Day 04: Sep 09, 2025 (09/09/2025)
Topics I covered: React State, state variables & the setter function, why you should never update state manually in react, updating current state, and the mechanics behind how state works. Completed a simple component called 'Steps'.

## Day 05: Sep 10, 2025 (10/09/2025)
Topics I covered: Solved a coding challenge - Date Counter, Started new project far away, Build layout & rendered list. 

## Day 06: Sep 11, 2025 (11/09/2025)
Topics I covered: Solved two coding challenges, what is thinking in react?, fundamentals of state management (when, where, how) & lifting up state. Added removing list item feature from Far Away project.

## Day 07: Sep 12, 2025 (12/09/2025)
Topics I covered: React child to parent communication, deleting & updating list item, derived state & avoiding useless calculations, added sorting & clearing feature in Far Away app and separated components into different files.

## Day 08: Sep 13, 2025 (13/09/2025)
Topics I covered: React - Children props, solved two coding challenges, build a simple accordion & tip calculator. Today I spent more time on coding.

## Day 09: Sep 14, 2025 (14/09/2025)
Topics I covered: Started working on Eat-N-Split (a mini project) Solved one react coding problem "Eat-N-Split" on my own and revised what I have already learnt. 

## Day 10: Sep 15, 2025 (15/09/2025)
Topics I covered: Continued working on the Eat-N-Split project. This project(small) was to practice basics of react js and to understand the logic of lifting up state & prop drilling.

## Day 11: Sep 17, 2025 (17/09/2025)
Topics I covered: Finished "Eat-N-Split" project. Analyzed the code & understood the core logic of states. Without React JS (or framework) the project would be time consuming.

## Day 12: Sep 18, 2025 (18/09/2025)
Topics I covered: Thinking in react, splitting UI into components, components categories and started working on 'usePopcorn' project.

## Day 13: Sep 19, 2025 (19/09/2025)
Topics I covered: Prop drilling, component categories, ways to fix prop drilling, component composition to make layout, explicit (as props) & implicit (as children) passing of elements.

## Day 14: Sep 20, 2025 (20/09/2025)
Topics I covered: Props as Component API, Reusability with props, PropTypes, Made 'Ratings' Component, Solved one coding challenge 'Text Expander'

## Day 15: Sep 21, 2025 (21/09/2025)
Topics I covered: Components, instances and elements, how rendering works, render phase.

## Day 16: Sep 22, 2025 (22/09/2025)
Topics I covered: The commit phase, how diffing works, diffing rules, key prop & resetting state. Fix 'Eat-n-split' & 'tab' component.

## Day 17: Sep 23, 2025 (23/09/2025)
Topics I covered: Rules for render logic - pure components, state update batching, how events work in react, and the react ecosystem.
