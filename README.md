# my-journey-of-reactjs
This repository is for tracking my reactjs learning. I will share my journey on daily basis and update this readme.

## Day 01: Sep 06, 2025 (06/09/2025)
I started learning react js from Jonas Schmedtmann. Topics I have covered: Why FE frameworks exists, React vs Vanilla Javascript, Pure React, Setting up dev environment, & New way of creating react app using vite. I completed first 3 sections of the course and the 4th one is js refreshing so I didn't watch it. Created my first react app using npm install -g yarn + yarn create react-app my-app, this npx create-react-app not worked for me.
